# Weather application written in Flask

## It is basic web application written in Flask with Python 3.5. It makes requests to http://api.openweathermap.org(so you will need their api key, for now you can use mine). 

### Todo

* gateway object is created with every request
* dropdown menu to choose localisation 
* better design (alpha bootstrap 4 maybe ?)
* database for weather maybe ?


## Contributions are nice, do not be shy !
